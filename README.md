TITLE:
MASM Calculate

DESCRIPTION:
This file is a MASM program that receives valid signed numbers from the user, and returns the numbers entered, a sum of these numbers, and the truncated average of all of these numbers.  The program achieves this by using two macros, one that retrieves a string of numbers from the user, and one that displays the string of numbers to the user.  The program first introduces itself, gives instruction to the user to provide a valid amount of signed numbers, converts the string input to integers and saves them, retrieves these integers and turns them into strings to display to the user.  The program then calculates the sum and average and returns it to the user using the macro.

INSTRUCTIONS:
	**MUST BE RUN ON A WINDOWS SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT**  
Since Microsoft Assembler only runs on Microsoft Windows, you will need access to a Windows installation. This may be achieved using a machine running Windows OS, or Citrix using Mac OS/OSX or Linux.  If running without Citrix, install and run from Visual Studio. Duplicate the directory on your machine.  Before running, makes sure to exclude this folder from Antivirus software (ASM files and other compiled executables are sometimes flagged with false positive detection from Antivirus software).  The core file is located in MASM calculate.asm however can be run by opening Project.sln with Visual Studio and running the program without debugging.
